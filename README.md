# go-uuid
## Introduction
The go-uuid library contains utilities to manipulate UUID unique identifiers
as defined by RFC 4122bis (draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis).

It currently supports UUID v4 and v7.

## Usage
Refer to the [Go package
documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/galdor/go-uuid) for
information about the API.

See the [`uuid` program](cmd/uuid/main.go) for a practical use case.
